#### commit with title of zettel
Name of the 'zettel' file is just a timestamp and gives no clou about the
content. Wrote a script that sets the title (first line) of the zettel as the commit
message.

Updated the former zettels now committed with zettel title.

#### script

    #!/usr/bin/sh

    cd ~/Notes/zet/

    file=$(git status | awk 'NR == 7 {print $3}')
    title=$(awk 'NR == 1' $file )

    git add $file
    git commit -m "$title"
    git push

    cd ~
