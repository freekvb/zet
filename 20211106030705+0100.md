#### commit with title of zettel


Name of the 'zettel' file is just a timestamp and gives no clou about the
content. Wrote a script that sets the title (first line) of the zettel as the commit
message.

Updated the former zettels now committed with zettel title.


#### script


script runs every 15 min.


```sh
    #!/usr/bin/sh

    cd ~/Notes/zet/

    file=$(git status | awk 'NR == 6 {print $1}') &&
    title=$(awk 'NR == 1' $file ) &&

    git add $file &&
    git commit -m "$title" &&
    git push &&

    eval "export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus"; /usr/bin/notify-send "zettel published on github"

    cd ~
```


This is the way .. ðŸ˜Š


```sh
> tags: #commit #title #script
```
