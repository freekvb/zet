# typing

#### practice
I'm a terible typist on a usual keyboard and on my own 'gergoplex' keyboard.
Thinking faster as typing, blind typing (no letters or symbols on the keys and
got to get used to the sensetifity of the keys. I can find the keys blind now,
but 'cause of the manu mistakes I'm distracted, frustrated and then typing gets
very bad.

I need to practice, every day a half an hour on 'monkeytype' should do the
trick, if and only if I do it every day .. so ..
