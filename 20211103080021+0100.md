---

#### 5 simple steps that I tested and used to make the change in under 1 minute.

Move the master branch to main

    git branch --move master main

Push main to remote repo

    git push --set-upstream origin main

Point HEAD to main branch

    git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main

Change default branch to main on GitHub

* Navigate in your browser to your GitHub repository.
* From the left rail, click Settings -> Branches and change the default branch to main

Delete master branch on the remote repo

    git push origin --delete master
