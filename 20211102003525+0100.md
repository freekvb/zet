#### Push to create a new project

To push a new project:

Identify the namespace you want to add the new project to, as you need this information in a future step. To determine if you have permission to create new projects in a namespace, view the groupâ€™s page in a web browser and confirm the page displays a New project button.

If you want to push using SSH, ensure you have created a SSH key and added it to your GitLab account.

Push with one of the following methods. Replace gitlab.example.com with the domain name of the machine that hosts your Git repository, namespace with the name of your namespace, and myproject with the name of your new project:

To push with SSH: git push --set-upstream git@gitlab.example.com:namespace/myproject.git master

To push with HTTPS: git push --set-upstream https://gitlab.example.com/namespace/myproject.git master Optional: to export existing repository tags, append the --tags flag to your git push command.

When the push completes, GitLab displays a message:


    remote: The private project namespace/myproject was created.


> tags: #gitlab #push #project
