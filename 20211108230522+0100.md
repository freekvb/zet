tmux, zsh and st

#### settings


I had some trubles setting up tmux 'the way I want it'. Tried several
combinations of settings in tmux.config and zshrc. Every time there was
something not working to my liking, mainly fucked up colors or in tmux or (in a
program) in st.

I'm not a heavy tmux user so it wasn't a big deal, but .. well I just have to
make things work. After some ddg searching got the configurations that forces
tmux to respect tmux color settings (different bg color active and inactive
window), transparency and my (pywal) color scheme.


**set in tmux.conf**


```sh
    # shell
    set -g default-shell /usr/bin/zsh

    # screen mode
    set -ga terminal-overrides "st-256color"
    set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
```

**start tmux with this alias**


```sh
    alias tm='TERM=st-256color tmux'    # start tmux in the right env
```

no need for (extra) settings in st or zsh


```sh
> tags: #tmux #zsh #st
```
