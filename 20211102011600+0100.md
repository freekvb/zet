github / gitlab

#### github and gitlab ?


Why both github and gitlab, so many projects running? Nope, just
thinking about migrating all my projects from github to gitlab. No
problems with the github workflow, nor thinking that it's better with
gitlab. It's just that gitlab is open source and github isn't.

What more to say I like open source.


#### mirror


For now all my projects on gitlab are mirroring the github repos. So I only
work with github and both github and gitlab are allways in sync up to date.

Total migration maybe later.


```sh
> tags: #github #gitlab #migration #mirror
```
