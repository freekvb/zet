#### 'whatever' knowledge

A zettelkasten, a collection of short notes or so called zettels about 'whatever
comes to mind'. The zettels are in markdown written with neovim, localy (GMT)
timestamped saved and with a cronjob script within 15 min. published on github.
The commit message is the title (the header) of the zettel and is with a script
automatically set.

The local collection zettels is searchable with a fzf 'find given string in all
files' function.
